\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numres} 
All update equations as defined in Section \ref{subsec:timestepeqs} were implemented in Rust. This language was choosen for its C++ like performance while enforcing compile-time memory safety which makes writing fast and safe CEM codes relatively easy. An overview of this implementation can be found in \ref{subsec:code}.

All simulations will be of a $0.1$ meter stretch of a WR-90, X-band waveguide with a cross section of $a=0.02286$ and $b=0.01016$ \cite{everythingrf} unless otherwise noted.
